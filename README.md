## Exercise: Number Range Validator

### Objective:
Write a Java program to validate if a given number is within a specific range. 

The program should ask the user to enter a number and then determine and display whether the number is within the valid range, considering the following rules:
-	Valid range: between 10 (including 10) and 50 (including 50).
-	Use short-circuit operators (&&) to efficiently evaluate the range condition.

### Instructions:
1. Ask the user to enter a number.
2. Use short-circuit operators to check if the number is within the valid range: check if the number is greater than or equal to 10 AND less than or equal to 50.
3. Display the result indicating whether the number is within the valid range or not.
